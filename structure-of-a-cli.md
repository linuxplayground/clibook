* [Comments](/comments.md)
* [Exit Codes](/exit-codes.md)



This part is all about the various components of BASH and what they mean and why we use them.  If you are already familar with BASH, then feel free to skim read this whole section.

A decent BASH script will contain the following elements:

* Interpreter Declaration
* Comments
* Input validation
* Exit Codes

Somewhere in all that, there will be the actual logic of the script.  Which will most likely comprise of functions and calls to other tools such as `grep`, `awk`, `sed` etc.
